There are a number of statistically significant determinants of participation. Two of the three economic variables„ income and land„are statistically significant. Households with supplementary income in addition to their income from agriculture are more likely to participate in user groups created by the PPP (coefficient = 0.477, significant at the 10% level). Similarly, households that own more land are more likely to participate to a greater extent in the groups created by the program (coefficient = 0.004, significant at the 5% level). Both the social variables are statistically significant. The high statistical significance of the caste variable confirms the hypothesis that lower-caste members participate relatively less in the user groups created by the PPP (coefficient = 0.554, significant at the 1% level). The education variable has a negative sign and is statistically significant (coefficient = -0.012, significant at the 5% level). This indicates that the higher the average number of years of education of the adult members in a household, the lower the likelihood of the household participating in the program.Of the two variables related to benefits from the resource (firewood and fodder), firewood is statistically significant. This means that as anticipated, households that use higher amounts of firewood from the forest are also more likely to try to participate in the program and to influence decision making in local groups through participation (coefficient = 0.1, statistically significant at the 5% level).

In essence, the programs are intended to achieve these twin goals by incentivizing local communities to manage state forests. However, there are pervasive imperfections in forest products markets that constrain the needed incentives; these imperfections arise mainly from limited infrastructure, high transport costs, few buyers, exploitive marketing chains and imperfect price information. One innovative approach to overcome these problems, which has been adopted by the Ethiopian government, is to organize JFM into community forest enterprises (CFE) in the form of forest usersÍ cooperatives (FUC) for forest products marketing.4 This provides the community with avenues for greater participation in value chains of forest products markets through vertical integration (VI) (Antinori, 2005; Gelo and Koch, 2014; Vega and Keenan, 2014).

From the decomposition analyses, our empirical results show that statistical 'discrimination' is the source of income disparity between male and female participants, accounting for 100 per cent of the total income differential, while the income disparity between high- and low-income participants is mainly due to the differences in endowments.

Similarly, empirical results from all the matching methods in the table indicate that low-income participants earn more forest income by participating in the program. We find that income gains to low income participants lie between MK13 (US$0.18) and MK26 (US$0.34) per month per household, an increase in forest income of between 35% and 98% from what they would have earned without participating in the program.",No,,0,1,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,

Table 8 presents the regression results of the effect of income level on total NTFPs extraction and dependence on NTFPs. Regression of NTFPs income to total income and income squared shows that within a range of household income NTFPs extraction increases and then falls with the increase in total income. The second regression of ratio of NTFPs income to total income indicates that a householdÍs dependence decreases gradually with a higher income level. But the positive sign with income squared indicates that NTFPs dependence on forest decreases at an increasing rate. This means that very rich households seldom go to the forest for NTFPs collection.

In this type of participatory forestry programme, the local people as programme beneficiaries provide their off-farm family labour. All other management inputs and technical supports are provided by the government. Here the main objectives are to integrate the people in this programme to ensure better plantation protection and to help them to find an alternative source of income to eradicate their poverty. At the same time, the local people who used to be treated as encroacher of forests and forest resources, are motivated to stop their destruction of the forest. As a result of their off farm family labour they are active beneficiaries of the programme.

The 1998 Wildlife Policy provided new opportunities for community management of wildlife resources [20]. WMA regulations were formulated in 2002 alongside the establishment of the first WMA, but a new Wildlife Policy in 2007 and ‘Non-Consumptive Utilization of Wildlife Regulations’ in 2008 recentralized many powers and benefits to the government [21].

In this program, the state and local communities jointly manage the state forests and share the benefits of increased forest resource stock and flow as a result of the management. Tumpang sari (TS), a temporal type of agroforestry, is a conventional way to provide such incentive.In TS, a parcel of state forestland is allocated to a farm household where members of that household plant teak trees and maintain the young trees for 2 years. TS attracts small or landless farmers in need of cultivation land who are dependent on forest resources for their livelihoods. In exchange for labor contributed toward planting and maintaining the trees, TS farmers receive a small cash payment and can keep all yields from intercropping of food crops such as maize (Zea mays indentata), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and cassava (Manihot esculenta). After 2 years, the farmers have to leave their TS parcel and can cultivate in a new parcel. A new social forestry program in the Gunung Kidul District namely Hutan Kemasyarakatan (HKM) was formulated in 2001 and established in 2002. Unlike in the conventional TS where food crop cultivation was allowed only for 2 years, in the HKM TS farmers were allowed to cultivate a parcel in state forestland for 25 years. They would plant their parcels with teak trees, maintain them, and share the timber with the state.
